1. Make sure that you are booting into legacy (not UEFI) BIOS 
2. Turn on Intel VT-d/Vt-x in the BIOS . Usually you shoud look for these in Security section in BIOS
3. Install Ubuntu , use LVM and make sure to leave some space for future DOM-U installations. It worked for me on NUC with Ubuntu LTS
but not on other box(es) , so I'd say use ubuntu server to be sure. When partitioning use LVM and decrease the partition size to 10-20G ,
the rest you can use to start VMs later
4. Install Xen: sudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-amd64
5. sudo reboot  now
6. add GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset" if you experience blank screen after reboot. run sudo update-grub
7. sudo xl list, should see Dom-0

8. sudo apt-get install gcc automake flex bison git libxen-dev libtool autoconf make pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libjson-c-dev
9. git clone https://github.com/libvmi/libvmi.git

10.
cd libvmi/
ls
./autogen.sh 
./configure --disable-kvm
make

If you want to install and run Windows VM on XEN with libvmi
1. Find an ISO image of Windows and copy it to the host
3. Create an lvgroup for disk, lvcreate --name <name> --size 20G vg, assuming your VG name is vg.
You can use vgrename to change the name of your VG 
2. Windows must be an HVM Domain. You can use /etc/xen/examples.hvm and cahnge it as necessary
Add boot="cd" and path to the cdrom drive. Edit file name to point to your lv and set vif to xenbr0
Use VNC=1 and vnclisten="0.0.0.0" 
3. Create xenbr0, follow Xen instructions
4. sudo xl create <name-of-your-file>
5. Once it have started open a VNC session from another computer to the xenbr0 ip address and install Windows
